# Welcome
Hello! I'm Erik Ohst, a new data scientist looking to further my skills and knowledge in my field. This blog serves as a repository for my projects, showcasing my skills, methodologies, and the outcomes of my work.

## What You'll Find Here
I hope to layout an informative yet entertaining narrative and documentation of my progress regularly. 

In each project I will make sure to highlight:
- Project Goals: The objectives and questions each project aims to address.
- Datasets Used: Details about the datasets, including sources and any preprocessing steps.
- Methodologies: The tools, techniques, and algorithms employed to analyze the data.
- Results: Visualizations, findings, and interpretations of the data analysis.
- Challenges and Learnings: Obstacles faced during the projects and the lessons learned along the way.

## Why This Blog?
In today's data-driven world, the ability to effectively communicate findings is as important as the technical skills required to discover them. This blog not only serves as a platform to demonstrate my technical expertise but also as a means to articulate complex data concepts in a clear and concise manner. It is my hope that this documentation provides potential employers with a comprehensive view of my capabilities and the value I can bring to their team.
